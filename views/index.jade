      p.lead
        | New York is full of negligent landlords. 
        | One major way landlords harass and abuse their tenants is by not providing essential services such as heat and hot water. 
        | The scale of the problem is huge. This heat season, there have been over 200,000 complaints regarding no heat or hot water.

    p From October 1st and May 1st, property owners <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/renters/important-safety-issues-heat-hot-water.page" target="_blank">must provide</a> adequate heat. Technically <a href="http://metcouncilonhousing.org/help_and_answers/heat_and_hot_water" target="_blank">landlords can be fined</a> for their negligence, yet they rarely get in trouble for what should be dangerous criminal activity.
    P When faced with dangerous freezing conditions, tenants have few options: report it to the overworked Department of Housing and Presenvation via 311 and/or attempt to get repairs through our shamefully ineffectual housing court system.
